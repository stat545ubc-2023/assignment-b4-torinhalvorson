This assignment will convert text to a modified version of piglatin,
called igplatinish. The rules to convert text from English (or any other
language) to igplatinish are as follows:

1.  For words beginning with vowels, the first vowel that follows at
    least one consonant is moved to the beginning of the word, along
    with the letters that immediately follow it (up to and including the
    next consonant).

2.  For words beginning with consonants, the first vowel, and the
    letters immediately following it, are moved to the beginning of the
    word

3.  Words too short or for which these criteria cannot be applied are
    left alone, but criterion 4 below still applies

4.  The sequence â€˜ishâ€™ is added to the end of the word

The following code defines a function, atpiglinish, that accepts a
single word as a string, and converts it to atpiglinish according to the
above rules.

``` r
#' Title igplatinish
#' @description This function converts text to a modified version of piglatin, called igplatinish. The rules to convert text from English (or any other language) to igplatinish are as follows: (1) For words beginning with vowels, the first vowel that follows at least one consonant is moved to the beginning of the word, along with the letters that immediately follow it (up to and including the next consonant) (2) For words beginning with consonants, the first vowel, and the letters immediately following it, are moved to the beginning of the word. (3) Words too short or for which these criteria cannot be applied are left alone, but criterion 4 below still applies. (4) The sequence 'ish' is added to the end of the word
#'
#' @param x a single string containing only letters

    stop("Input must be a single word compoased of only letters with no punctuation.")
  }
  
  #If the word is too short or the criteria cannot be applied, return the word unchanged as 'output'. The word must be at least three letters and contain at least one consonant-vowels-consonant sequence (containing one or several consecutive vowels)

    #This extracted the consonant-vowels-consonant sequence, but we only wish to replace the vowel(s) (we needed to extract the whole sequence to ensure that the vowel(s) follow a consonant). Now, we will extract the vowel and the letters that follow it using a second extraction from the first extract.
    
    motif1 <- str_extract(motif, "([aeiouAEIOU]+)([^aeiouAEIOU])")
    x1 <- str_replace(x, glue("{motif1}"), "")
